# Angularfe

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.5.

## Developer Notes
This is a challenge for Nestegg that utilizes Angular, AngularMaterial, Boostrap.
All data is stored locally without a backend.

Current features include:
    * Responsive pages using Bootsrap and Angular Material.
    * JSON generated form that captures and validates inputs and stores in Local Storage.
    * Analytics page that currently shows counts of users who answered questions.  INCOMPLETE due to time constraints.
    * Login page that authenticates a mocked user.  Prevents access to app without authentication.

All actions for data can be converted to call API's.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
